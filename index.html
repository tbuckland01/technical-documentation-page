                    <p>SVG is an XML language, similar to XHTML, which can be used to draw vector graphics. It can be used to create an image either by specifying all the lines and shapes necessary, by modifying already existing raster images, or by a combination of both. The image and its components can also be transformed, composited together, or filtered to change their appearance completely.</p>
                    <p>SVG came about in 1999 after several competing formats had been submitted to the W3C and failed to be fully ratified. SVG is supported by all major browsers. A downside is loading SVG can be slow. SVG does offer benefits, some of which include having a DOM interface available for it, and not requiring third-party extensions. Whether or not to use it often depends on your specific use case.</p>

                    <p>HTML provides elements for defining headers, paragraphs, tables, and so on. In much the same way SVG provides elements for circles, rectangles, and simple and complex curves. A simple SVG document consists of nothing more than the <code>svg</code> root element and several basic shapes that build a graphic together. In addition there is the <code>g</code> element, which is used to group several basic shapes together.</p>
                    <p>Starting from there, the SVG image can become arbitrarily complex. SVG supports gradients, rotations, filter effects, animations, interactivity with JavaScript, and so on. But all these extra features of the language rely on this relatively small set of elements to define the graphics area.</p>

                    <p>There are a number of drawing applications available such as Inkscape which are free and use SVG as their native file format. However, this documentation will rely on the trusty XML or text editor (your choice). The idea is to teach the internals of SVG to those who want to understand it, and that is best done by dirtying your hands with a bit of markup. You should note your final goal though. Not all SVG viewers are equal and so there is a good chance that something written for one app will not display exactly the same in another, because they support different levels of the SVG specification or another specification that you are using along with SVG (that is, JavaScript or CSS).</p>
                    <p>Before starting you should have a basic understanding of XML or another markup language such as HTML. If you are not too familiar with XML, here are some guidelines to keep in mind:
                        <ul>
                            <li>SVG elements and attributes should all be entered in the case shown here since XML is case-sensitive (unlike HTML).</li>
                            <li>Attribute values in SVG must be placed inside quotes, even if they are numbers.</li>
                        </ul>           
                    </p>
                    <p>SVG is a huge specification. This tutorial attempts to cover the basics. Once you are familiar you should be able to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element">Element Reference</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model#svg_interfaces">Interface Reference</a> to find out anything else you need to know.</p>

                    <p>The first important thing to notice is the order of rendering elements. The globally valid rule for SVG files is, that later elements are rendered atop previous elements. The further down an element is the more it will be visible.</p>
                    <p>SVG files on the web can be displayed directly in the browser or embedded in HTML files via several methods:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the HTML is XHTML and is delivered as type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, the SVG can be directly embedded in the XML source.</li>
                            <li>If the HTML is HTML5, and the browser is a conforming HTML5 browser, the SVG can also be directly embedded. However, there may be syntax changes necessary to conform to the HTML5 specification.</li>
                            <li>The SVG file can be referenced with an <code>object</code> element: <code>&lt;object data="image.svg" type="image/svg+xml" /&gt;</code></li>
                            <li>Likewise an <code>iframe</code> element can be used: <code>&lt;iframe src="image.svg"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></li>
                            <li>An <code>img</code> element can theoretically be used too. However, this technique doesn't work in Firefox before 4.0.</li>
                            <li>Finally, SVG can be created dynamically with JavaScript and injected into the HTML DOM. With this method, replacement technologies can be implemented for browsers which normally can't process SVG.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>SVG files come in two flavors. Normal SVG files are simple text files containing SVG markup. The recommended filename extension for these files is ".svg" (all lowercase).</p>
                    <p>Due to the potentially massive size SVG files can reach when used for some applications (e.g., geographical applications), the SVG specification also allows for gzip-compressed SVG files. The recommended filename extension for these files is ".svgz" (all lowercase). Unfortunately, it is very problematic to get gzip-compressed SVG files to work reliably across all SVG capable user agents when served from a Microsoft IIS server, and Firefox cannot load gzip-compressed SVG from the local computer. Avoid gzip-compressed SVG except when you are publishing to a webserver that you know will serve it correctly (see below).</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Now that you have an idea of how to create basic SVG files, the next stage is to upload them to a Webserver. There are some gotchas at this stage though. For normal SVG files, servers should send the HTTP headers: <code>Content-Type: image/svg+xml Vary: Accept-Encoding</code></p>
                    <p>For gzip-compressed SVG files, servers should send the HTTP headers: <code>Content-Type: image/svg+xml Content-Encoding: gzip Vary: Accept-Encoding</code></p>
                    <p>You can check that your server is sending the correct HTTP headers with your SVG files by using the Network Monitor panel or a site such as websniffer.cc. Submit the URL of one of your SVG files and look at the HTTP response headers. If you find that your server is not sending the headers with the values given above, then you should contact your Web host. If you have problems convincing them to correctly configure their servers for SVG, there may be ways to do it yourself. See the server configuration page on the w3.org for a range of simple solutions.</p>
                    <p>Server misconfiguration is a very common reason for SVG failing to load, so make sure you check yours. If your server is not configured to send the correct headers with the SVG files it serves, then Firefox will most likely show the markup of the files as text or encoded garbage, or even ask the viewer to choose an application to open them.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>For all elements, SVG uses a coordinate system or grid system similar to the one used by canvas (and by a whole lot of other computer drawing routines). That is, the top left corner of the document is considered to be the point (0,0), or point of origin. Positions are then measured in pixels from the top left corner, with the positive x direction being to the right, and the positive y direction being to the bottom. Note that this is slightly different than the way you're taught to graph as a kid (y axis is flipped). However, this is the same way elements in HTML are positioned (By default, LTR documents are considered not the RTL documents which position X from right-to-left).</p>

                <article>
                    <p>To insert a shape, you create an element in the document. Different elements correspond to different shapes and take different parameters to describe the size and position of those shapes. Some are slightly redundant in that they can be created by other shapes, but they're all there for your convenience and to keep your SVG documents as short and as readable as possible. All the basic shapes are shown in the image to the right. The code to generate that looks something like:
                        <div class="code-image">

                    <p>The <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> element is the most powerful element in the SVG library of basic shapes. It can be used to create lines, curves, arcs, and more.</p>
                    <p>Paths create complex shapes by combining multiple straight lines or curved lines. Complex shapes composed only of straight lines can be created as <code>&lt;polyline&gt;</code>s. While <code>&lt;polyline&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>s can create similar-looking shapes, <code>&lt;polyline&gt;</code>s require a lot of small straight lines to simulate curves, and don't scale well to larger sizes.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Basic coloring can be done by setting two attributes on the node: <code>fill</code> and <code>stroke</code>. Using fill sets the color inside the object and stroke sets the color of the line drawn around the object. You can use the same css color naming schemes that you use in HTML, whether that's color names (that is red), rgb values (that is rgb(255,0,0)), hex values, rgba values, etc.</p>
                    <p>In addition, you can specify the opacity of either the <code>fill</code> or <code>stroke</code> separately in SVG. These are controlled by the <code>fill-opacity</code> and <code>stroke-opacity</code> attributes.</p>
                    <p>In addition to its color properties, there are a few other attributes available to control the way a stroke is drawn on a line.</p>
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Fills_and_Strokes">Detailed information about these other attributes can be found here.</a></p>

                <article>
                    <p>Perhaps more exciting than just fills and strokes is the fact that you can also create and apply gradients as either fills or strokes.</p>
                    <p>There are two types of gradients: linear and radial. You <b>must</b> give the gradient an <code>id</code> attribute; otherwise it can't be referenced by other elements inside the file.  Gradients are defined in a defs section as opposed to on a shape itself to promote reusability.</p>
                    <h3>Linear Gradient</h3>
                    <p>Linear gradients change along a straight line. To insert one, you create a <code>&lt;linearGradient&gt;</code> node inside the definitions section of your SVG file.</p>
                    <h3>Radial Gradient</h3>
                    <p>Radial gradients are similar to linear ones but draw a gradient that radiates out from a point. To create one you add a <code>&lt;radialGradient&gt;</code> element to the definitions section of your document.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>Patterns are arguably one of the more confusing fill types to use in SVG. They're also very powerful, so they're worth talking about and getting at least a fundamental grasp on. Like gradients, the <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code> element should be put in the <code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> section of your SVG file.</p>
                    <p>Example:
                        <div class="code-image">
<pre class="code-format"><code>
    &lt;svg width="200" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
        &lt;defs&gt;
            &lt;linearGradient id="Gradient1"&gt;
                &lt;stop offset="5%" stop-color="white"/&gt;
                &lt;stop offset="95%" stop-color="blue"/&gt;
            &lt;/linearGradient&gt;
            &lt;linearGradient id="Gradient2" x1="0" x2="0" y1="0" y2="1"&gt;
                &lt;stop offset="5%" stop-color="red"/&gt;
                &lt;stop offset="95%" stop-color="orange"/&gt;
            &lt;/linearGradient&gt;
        
            &lt;pattern id="Pattern" x="0" y="0" width=".25" height=".25"&gt;
                &lt;rect x="0" y="0" width="50" height="50" fill="skyblue"/&gt;
                &lt;rect x="0" y="0" width="25" height="25" fill="url(#Gradient2)"/&gt;
                &lt;circle cx="25" cy="25" r="20" fill="url(#Gradient1)" fill-opacity="0.5"/&gt;
            &lt;/pattern&gt;
        &lt;/defs&gt;
        
        &lt;rect fill="url(#Pattern)" stroke="black" width="200" height="200"/&gt;

                <article>
                    <p>When talking about text in SVG we have to differentiate two almost completely separate topics. The one is the inclusion and display of text in an image, and the other are SVG fonts. The latter may be described in a later section of the tutorial, while we will focus completely on the first part: Bringing text into an SVG image.</p>
                    <h3>Basics</h3>
                    <p>The <code>text</code> element can be used to put arbitrary text in SVG documents. For example:
                        <code>
                            &lt;text x="10" y="10"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/text&gt;
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>The <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> attributes determine, where in the viewport the text will appear. The attribute <code>text-anchor</code>, which can have the values "start", "middle", "end" or "inherit", decides in which direction the text flows from this point. The attribute <code>dominant-baseline</code> decides the vertical alignment.</p>
                    <p>Like with the shape elements text can be colorized with the <code>fill</code> attribute and given a stroke with the <code>stroke</code> attribute. Both may also refer to gradients or patterns, which makes simple coloring text in SVG very powerful compared to CSS 2.1.</p>
                    <h3>Setting font properties</h3>
                    <p>An essential part of a text is the font in which it is displayed. SVG offers a set of attributes, many similar to their CSS counterparts, to enable font selection. Each of the following properties can be set as an attribute or via a CSS declaration: <code>font-family</code>, <code>font-style</code>, <code>font-weight</code>, <code>font-variant</code>, <code>font-stretch</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>font-size-adjust</code>, <code>kerning</code>, <code>letter-spacing</code>, <code>word-spacing</code> and <code>text-decoration</code>.</p>
                    <h3>tspan and textPath</h3>
                    <p>The tspan element is used to mark up sub-portions of a larger text. It must be a child of a <code>text</code> element or another <code>tspan</code> element. A typical use case is to paint one word of a sentence bold red:
<pre class="code-format"><code>
    &lt;text&gt;
        This is &lt;tspan font-weight="bold" fill="red"&gt;bold and red&lt;/tspan&gt;
    &lt;/text&gt;                             
</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>The textPath element fetches via its <code>xlink:href</code> attribute an arbitrary path and aligns the characters, that it encircles, along this path:
<pre class="code-format"><code>
    &lt;path id="my_path" d="M 20,20 C 80,60 100,40 120,20" fill="transparent" /&gt;
    &lt;text&gt;
        &lt;textPath xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#my_path"&gt;
            A curve.
        &lt;/textPath&gt;
    &lt;/text&gt;
</code></pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>Let's formally introduce the <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> element. With this helper, you can assign properties to a complete set of elements. Actually, that's its only purpose. An example:
<pre class="code-format"><code>
    &lt;svg width="30" height="10"&gt;
        &lt;g fill="red"&gt;
            &lt;rect x="0" y="0" width="10" height="10" /&gt;
            &lt;rect x="20" y="0" width="10" height="10" /&gt;
        &lt;/g&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;
</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Transformations">These basic transformations</a> are summed up in an element's <code>transform</code> attribute. Transformations can be chained by concatenating them, separated by whitespace.</p>

                    <p>Erasing part of what one has created might at first sight look contradictory. But when you try to create a semicircle in SVG, you will find out the use of the following properties quickly.</p>
                    <p><b>Clipping</b> refers to removing parts of elements defined by other parts. In this case, any half-transparent effects are not possible, it's an all-or-nothing approach.</p>
                    <p><b>Masking</b> on the other hand allows soft edges by taking transparency and grey values of the mask into account.</p>
